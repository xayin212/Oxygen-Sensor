# Oxygen-Sensor
Schematic of Oxygen Sensor using LTSpice using the SGX-40X to alarm those that are in a dangerously low oxygen supply to alert them of so. This schematic uses a combination of precision op-amps, inductors, capacitors, and resistors in order to elicit an LED and audio output to alert those around to leave the area.
